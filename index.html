        <h3>SUBJECT PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS:</h3>
        <p>
            The modern theory of Markowitz tells us that building a diversified portfolio of assets is the key to minimize the risks related to an investment. To do so, the portfolio must be composed of assets that react differently to the same events. That is why it is essential to demonstrate the dependency relationship between those assets.<br />
            Common approaches to portfolio optimization require classical correlation measurements (such as Spearman or Pearson methods) which are not appropriate to model the dependency between the yields.<br /><br />
            That’s why we need copula in order to have better models. Thus, our goal is to optimize a portfolio using an estimated parameter that we have to find thanks to copulas.<br />

        <h3>WORK ORGANISATION:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Organization inside the team</li>
            <p>
                Right at the first meeting, we created a Microsoft Teams’ group to be able to communicate easily between the members of our group, and most importantly, to have a conversation that would exclusively be used for work. The team is notified right away when we have news from our partner, or when a member uploads something on the teams’ Google Drive.<br /><br />
                We named Ana as the leader of the group because a leader appeared to us to be necessary in order to have a good communication and a better distribution of the roles and tasks of each member of the group. Despite the fact that the group has its leader, each member takes full responsibility for the tasks they need to accomplish.<br /><br />
                We try to meet as much as possible when needed. At the beginning of every meeting, we define the different topics we need to discuss about and what we need to do during the meeting. Usually, we always have something to prepare for the meeting, whether it is something concrete (such as a piece of coding), or some reading of the different lectures that have been given to us. At the end of each meeting, we discuss about what needs to be done for the next week, and what is the assignment of each member.<br /><br />
                Every meeting has its own report in order to sum up all the things that were said and done during the meeting, and so that everyone can report to it in case of any doubt. Each report is added onto the teams Google Drive file. Moreover, every time we realize something concrete (an algorithm for example, or the recovery of data on Bloomberg) we upload the file onto Google Drive so that every member has access to it.<br /><br />
                Every member works one at two hours per day on the project to continue the advancement of the meeting we did at the beginning of the week and every 2 days we put the individually work on the Google Drive we created for the project.<br /><br />

            </p>
            <li>Organization with the partner</li>
            <p>
                We met with the partner to kick off the project. At that meeting, he explained us what the project was about, and the steps to achieve. He especially detailed the first tasks we would have to do to start the project and spent a lot of time explaining us the theory behind all we were going to do.<br /><br />
                We communicate with our partner via emails, so we can schedule meetings when needed, or ask him questions necessary to the progress of our work in group and individually. When we finish a step of the project, we sum it up to the partner, that gives us directives for what we need to do next.<br /><br />
                Our partner gives us a certain freedom in the project. In fact, he gave us the form and the steps of the project, but we are free to choose the programming language for example.<br /><br />
                The meetings with the partner are made when we finish a big step in the project, we need him to look at what we did. When he confirms our work, he gives us the necessary information’s to start the next step and continue the project.<br /><br /><br />

            </p>
        </ul>
        <h3>EFFECTIVE WORK DONE:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>02/10/19 - Start of the project</li>
            <p>
                We have booked our meeting with the partner for October 7th, and the partner gave us some directions to start working before the meeting. We started to become familiar with the different documents that were sent by the partner and the different steps we would need to do at the beginning.
            </p>
            <li>07/10/19 - First meeting with the partner</li>
            <p>
                At the first meeting, the partner explained us what the project was about, and the steps to achieve. He especially detailed the first tasks we would have to do to start the project and spent a lot of time explaining us the theory behind all we were going to do. We went to the Bloomberg room so that he could explain us efficiently the project, as we work on a portfolio of different assets.
            </p>
            <li>13/10/19 – First meeting with the team – The video making</li>
            <p>
                Once we had a good knowledge of the project, we joined together to produce the animated video we had to deliver for October 13th. We agreed on making an animated video, so we researched the software that could be used. We then thought and wrote the script of the video, but we also produced and imagined the different animations and effects of the video. Ana who was comfortable with the software has perfected transitions and background music. After finishing the video, we put ourselves totally in the bulk of the project.
            </p>
            <li>04/11/19 – Team meeting</li>
            <p>
                The first step of our project was to recover data from Bloomberg. To do so, we got together in the Bloomberg room. We started by becoming familiar with importing Bloomberg data into Excel. We recovered daily prices and returns from 2009 to 2019 of different monetary and financial assets of different classes from Bloomberg. We agreed on creating an algorithm to compute the different measures we needed for our next meeting.<br /><br />
                We then had to build an efficient portfolio according to modern portfolio theory. The first step was to calculate the correlation matrix of all assets that will allow us to build our portfolio. We decided to code on our side on different languages to then choose the languages and therefore the most appropriate codes.

            </p>
            <li>18/11/19 - Last meetings</li>
            <p>
                We have to build an efficient portfolio according to the modern portfolio theory. The first step was then to calculate the correlation matrix of all assets that will allow us to build our portfolio. We decided that each member would code on his side a code on the language he’d wanted. At this meeting we took stock of all our codes. We have retained a python code and an R code which provide the same results that can be used at different times of the project.            </p>
            <li>Conclusion:</li>
            <p>
                So, with the different tasks that had to be done but also all that we had to learn in order to move forward, we made sure to work an average of 10 hours per week in different ways depending on the progress of the project:

        <h3>WHAT'S NEXT?</h3>
        <p>
            We are now going to read and work on the different documents given by our partner, in order to be able to create a portfolio that is efficient according to the Markowitz’s modern portfolio theory.<br /><br />
            When that will be done, we will compute the different risk measures of the portfolio (Value-At- Risk, Conditional Value-At-Risk etc...). But all the work we have done until now is done with variance-covariance measures. The problem with the use of this method, is that in case of an extreme scenario, the response of our portfolio with variance-covariance won’t be representative of the reality as the relationship between asset will become asymmetrical during those scenarios.<br /><br />
            As explained by our partner, it is important to highlight the dependence relationship between financial asset that are well represented, as the portfolio optimisation is made according to the correlation measures between assets.<br /><br />
            Our final aim is to do the same work with copulas. In fact, we started by creating a diverse portfolio in the meaning of variance-covariance measures. We will be working with copulas, that are a multivariate cumulative distribution function for which the marginal probability distribution of each variable is uniform. That means that copulas are a mathematical instrument that allow us to create a diverse portfolio that will support a crisis or an intense phenomenon. When using copulas, we can represent the dependence relationships without it being distorted. We will have then more adequate relationships between assets, and therefore a more optimised portfolio.<br /><br />
            Therefore, we will re-create out portfolio by computing the correlation between assets with copulas, make a copula function which is bi-varied for each couple of assets, and by calculating the couple return-risk of our portfolio. We are then going to estimate de dependence matrix of our portfolio with statistics tests and copulas method, in order to build the dependence matrix of the portfolio. After that, we will then proceed to the optimization of the couple risk-return of the portfolio, in order to minimize as much as possible, the risk of our portfolio according to the dependence measures.<br /><br /><br />
